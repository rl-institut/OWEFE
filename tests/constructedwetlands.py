# average COD (influent) from Anaerobic digester in range 1500 to 2000 mg/L (source: Metcalf and Eddy(2004))
# ratio between BOD / COD (influent) is 0.3 to 0.8
# ratio between BOD / COD (effluent) is 0.1 to 0.3 -> we take avg ratio: 0.5
# For plug flow, BOD5 -> first order kinematics
# K1 -> constant (Reed et al, 1988)
# Hydraulic retention time 4days is highly effective (source: D. Ghosh et al., 2010)
# porosity (typically) 0.4 for 25-mm gravel
# temperature remain constant between 31 - 33 degree Celsius
# Depth of CW (m) = [1 â€“ 1.8m usually]
# net discharge is excluding seepage that is 10% of total discharge
# average nitrate in influent water is assume to 450mg/L (source: case study of FSM in leh town,Ladhak/TUM)
# cw_area multiplied by 24 to convert into day
# net evaporation is calculate in mm/day
# HRT = 4days
