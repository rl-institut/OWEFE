Dewatered Sludge [tons/a],627,851.55,
Biogas Production [m³/a],61919,83220,"Why is OWEFE Biogas Production higher? Retention time difference? OWEFE: 22 days, We do not have the same digester; digester design acording to the maximum annual incoming mass flow "
Methane Production [m³],37151.4,49932,
Electrictal Energy Production [MWh/a],119.17,148.02,
Electricity Demand Digester [MWh/a],21.74,24.02,"Why is OWEFE electricity demand of digester higher? We assumed higher energy demand for mixing; continously mixing the filled up volume of the digester tank 7.9 W/m³ filled up volume, how did they calculate it?"
